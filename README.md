# ChatBot
I used the ChatGPT API to develop the ChatBot App, which is similar to ChatGPT.

We have seen many apps and websites in which we will get to see a chatbot where we can chat along with the chatbot and can easily get solutions for our questions answered from the chatbot.
In this article, we will take a look at building a chatbot in Android. 

# Key Features:
Real-time Conversations: Engage in dynamic conversations with the OpenAI GPT-3 model.
User-friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive user interface for seamless chatting.
Message History: Display a history of sent and received messages.
OpenAI Integration: Utilize the power of the OpenAI API for text completion.

# Get Started:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Android Studio.
Replace YOUR_API_KEY in callAPI() with your OpenAI API key.
Build and run the app on your Android device or emulator.

# File Structure:

-MainActivity.java: The main activity managing chat functionality and API calls.
-Message.java: Data model for individual chat messages.
-MessageAdapter.java: RecyclerView adapter for displaying messages.
-chat_item.xml: Layout XML file for the main chat activity.

# Generating API key for using the chatbot service:
Go to Brainshop.ai generate your simple account with your username and password. Simply create your account on this website. After creating a new account you will get to see the below screen. After creating your account you have to request a new password from the request password option and enter your email address. After adding your email address you have to add the password to your account. Now we are good to go to generate our API key.
