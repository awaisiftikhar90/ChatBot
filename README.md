# ChatBot
I used the ChatGPT API to develop the ChatBot App, which is similar to ChatGPT.

We have seen many apps and websites in which we will get to see a chatbot where we can chat along with the chatbot and can easily get solutions for our questions answered from the chatbot.
In this article, we will take a look at building a chatbot in Android.

#Generating API key for using the chatbot service
Go to Brainshop.ai generate your simple account with your username and password. Simply create your account on this website. After creating a new account you will get to see the below screen. After creating your account you have to request a new password from the request password option and enter your email address. After adding your email address you have to add the password to your account. Now we are good to go to generate our API key.
